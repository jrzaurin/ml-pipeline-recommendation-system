# Recommendation System using Amazon Reviews Dataset

The scope of this project is to build a realistic pipeline for a
recommendation system.

The dataset that we will be using will be the [Amazon reviews
dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). These data includes
reviews in the range of May 1996 - Oct 2018. Initially, I have no intention of
using all reviews. The idea is to use the last 3-5 years to build the system.

The goal of this, and the companion project is to build realistic pipelines
and ML projects that practitioners find useful, therefore, apart from the
algorithmic consideration we will be running a simulation to reproduce a real
world scenario. In such scenario, new items and users visit Amazon and items
need to be recommended and users need to see new recommendation. At the time
of writing this document the details of such simulation are still not
completely defined.

The task of the team is now to define the following standard steps.

1. Design the project (Important within a business environment)
2. Collect the data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Benchmarking
4. Decide the tools for the project
5. Off-line testing
6. Implement the selected solution in production
7. On-line testing
8. Monitor

Note this is an "organic" document that will be constantly updated as the
project evolves.
